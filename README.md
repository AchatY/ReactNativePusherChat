# ReactNativePusherChat
In an effort to try react-native + redux, I stumbled on [Pusher](https://pusher.com) which is a realtime communication
platform that allows you to push messages to multiple listeners.

Creating a Chat application based on this technology stack was cool and very exciting and I hope you gain as much experience
and fun as I did after building this. 

Its yet to be completed and will soon be but its a `very` minimalist chat application but I think with this you can get a bit
of hint on how to build a real chat app

You need a [Pusher](https://pusher.com) App created and also the App's API_KEY to be able to use [Pusher](https://pusher.com)
